A. Please explain us the chosen implementation, including its advantages and disadvantages:

    First, I have been choose the Ansible sulotion mostly because I have some experience using it.

    Ansible designed to use as a configuration managment tool and implament those kind of tasks.

    Regardless my experience I think that the fact most of the tasks has a proper moodules also support this claim.

B. Make the translation somewhere along the proxy chain, and explain why you chose that specific configuration:

    Iv'e been choose to made the translation outside the LAN (near) because we are using generic port (443) which could be used by our gateway somehow.

    But, And it's a big but sometimes thg internet provider block higer ports which could be hard to identify. So it's depand on our network architecture.
